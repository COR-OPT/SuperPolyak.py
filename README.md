# SuperPolyak.py


This repository contains a prototype implementation of the algorithms from the following paper:

V. Charisopoulos, D. Davis. A superlinearly convergent subgradient method for sharp semismooth problems, 2022. URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04611.

The implementation is available as a Python module called SuperPolyak.py, which can be embedded in other python applications. 

A minimal demo is available in the fileThe core algorithms can be found under src/SuperPolyak.jl. Under scripts/, we have included all the scripts necessary to reproduce the numerical experiments in the paper. We recommend running the code using Julia 1.6 or later.
